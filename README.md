WebhookX is an open-source webhooks gateway for message receiving, processing, and delivering.

## Features

- **Admin API:** Expose a RESTful API on port `:8080` for managing WebhookX entities.
- **Retries:** Automatically retry unsuccessful deliveries with configurable delays.
- **Fan out:** Route events to multiple endpoints based on the event type.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect the gateway ingestion and delivery endpoints from overload.
- **Declarative configuration:** Manage WebhookX through declarative configuration files to achieve GitOps/DevOps workflows.
- **Multi tenancy:**  Multiple workspaces. Each workspace provides the isolation of configuration entities.
- **Plugins:** Extend functionality via inbound and outbound plugins.
  - `webhookx-signature`: Sign outbound requests with HMAC(SHA-256) by adding `Webhookx-Signature` and `Webhookx-Timestamp` headers.
  - `wasm`: Transform outbound requests using high-level languages such as AssemblyScript, Rust or TinyGo. See [plugin/wasm](plugins/wasm).
  - `function`: Customize inbound behavior with JavaScript, e.g. signature verification or request body transformation.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing for monitoring and troubleshooting.



## Installation

WebhookX binary provides you both Server and CLI command.

### macOS

```shell
brew tap webhookx-io/webhookx && brew install webhookx
```

### Linux | Windows

Download the binary distribution on [releases](https://github.com/webhookx-io/webhookx/releases).

## Get started

> [!TIP]
> This is only for evaluating features and is not suitable for production. For production deployment, please refer [documentation](https://docs.webhookx.io/docs/).

### 1. Start WebhookX using Docker Compose

The  [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/webhookx-io/webhookx/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) provides a simple all-in-one (standalone) deployment for quick start.

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webhookx-io/webhookx/main/docker-compose.yml && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Once it's running, you will see HTTP 200 response

```
curl http://localhost:8080
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Server: WebhookX/0.9.0

{
    "version": "0.9.0",
    "message": "Welcome to WebhookX",
  	"configuration": {}
}
```



### 2. Setup entities configuration

Let's use a sample declarative configuration [webhookx.sample.yml](https://github.com/webhookx-io/webhookx/blob/main/webhookx.sample.yml) in this quick start.

> You may need to install CLI `webhookx` first, see [Installation](#Installation).

```
webhookx admin sync webhookx.sample.yml
```

This command sends the configuration file to WebhookX via Admin API.

Once it is set up, you're ready to send events to WebhookX.



### 3. Send events to WebhookX

> The Ingestion is exposed on port  `:8081`

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081 \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "event_type": "charge.succeeded",
    "data": {
        "key": "value"
    }
}'
```

We sent a `charge.succeeded` event including `data` to WebhookX, and it will be routed and delivered to endpoints that are defined in the `webhookx.sample.yml`file.



### 4. Inspect delivery result

> [!TIP]
>
> Attempt object represents the delivery result of an event, and contains inspection information. 

> The Admin is exposed on port  `:8080`

Let's make a request to retrieve the attempt list

```
curl http://localhost:8080/workspaces/default/attempts
```
